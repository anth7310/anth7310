## [NBA Analysis](https://github.com/daboucha/nba-analysis)
Using NBA data sets, our team will run supervised machine learning to answer whether or not the outcome of a game can be predicted with high accuracy.

## [2022 U.S. Domestic Airport and Airline Delay Predictor](https://github.com/Herbert-0820/FinalProject)
* According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in the year 2019 there were over 810 million passengers aboard U.S. scheduled airline flights. And that staggering figure is only accounting Domestic flights.
* In the same year of 2019, the US Domestic flight industry racked in almost 160 billion USD in revenue from these passenger flights.
* A quick look at the number of commercial air carriers in the US, with 22 current major carriers in 2021. And smaller air carriers with the 43 counted in 2021. In 2019, there were 5,217 public airports in the U.S.

## [Vaccine Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Group-5-Final-Project/Final-Project)
The emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic has normalized vaccines to become a part of everyday discourse, as global efforts to increase vaccination rates continue. Considered to have an integral role in managing the pandemic, governments, employers, and other organizations have either implemented or considered vaccine mandates, and this has possibly become the most contentious topic in the last couple of years.

As expected, there are varying opinions about vaccines, which range from their safety or effectiveness, to whether the mandates infringe on human rights. Anti-vaxx sentiments well-predate COVID, however given how pervasive vaccine discourse has become, they seem to be on the rise. Understanding the causes and levels of vaccine hesitancy is an important first step in addressing the factors that prevent people from getting vaccinated.

For this project, we took to Twitter to gather vaccine sentiments from the beginning of the pandemic to present, in an effort to address the following questions:

* What are the sentiments towards vaccines?
    * Positive, negative, or neutral
* How have these sentiments changed throughout the course of the pandemic, if at all?
    * Do pandemic milestones (e.g. waves, mandates, laws, etc.) impact opinions?
* What word associations are found with the word vaccine?
* Are we really as divided on vaccines as it seems?
Data extracted from Twitter will be stored in a Postgres database, analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the findings will be visualized on a custom dashboard.

## [US Accidents](https://github.com/Sparkythephoenix/US_Accidents_DataAnalysis)

In 2019, U.S. traffic crashes cost employers $72.2 billion in direct crash-related expenses which include medical care, liability, lost productivity and property damage. It means that reducing the number of car crashes is an important task. The proactive approach to decreasing car accidents include preventing potential unsafe road conditions and making people aware of factors increasing the probability of getting into car accident. One way to implement this approach is to create car accident prediction and crash severity models. Knowing crucial factors leading to car crashes and geography of those, authorities might be able to distribute financial and human resources better.

## [Toronto Bike Sharing Demand Prediction](https://github.com/kaylaisnomyname/group7)

Bike sharing is a shared transport service using bike on a short term for a price. The sturdy-framed bikes are available at any docking station in the city. The bikes can be taken from any station and returned to any station in the bike share system. Riders use bike share for commuting to work or leisureâ€”like running errands, going to appointments or meeting up with friends.Riders also can use bike to connect to public transportation or just doing exercise for exploring the city.

Weather conditions have considerable influence on cycling travel behavior. Our goal in this project is to create a viable machine learning model to explore possible correlation(s) between the different types of weather conditions and the demand on bike sharing.

## [Predicting Arctic Sea Ice Extent Using Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_4)

We want to see if we could predict the melting of Arctic Sea Ice using the time series predictive model SARIMAX using Python. We selected this topic because we wanted to predict at what point in time would the sea ice shrink. It is a topic that all the team members felt passionate about and wanted to explore.

## [The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health](https://github.com/mogazz69/COVID-19-and-mental-health)
The U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of Covid-19 on American households. The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.

The survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely weekly estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, gender, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions,

## [Real Estate Predictions](https://github.com/Realestate-Module-Predictions/Real_estate)

Our aim is to predict the selling price of currently active listed real estate properties in Toronto. We collectively agreed on using the tools and knowledge given to us during this course to manipulate, store, perform ETL and analysis on data. We will train a machine learning on prices of sold inactive listings to predict how much the currently listed unsold units would be sold for in Toronto.

## [Is the Sunshine list still revelant for the Ontario taxpayers?](https://github.com/Shaza-Safi/Ontario_Sunshine_List)

[Dashboard](https://shaza-safi.github.io/SunshineListAnalysis-Website/)

The Sunshine list is annual list includes public sector employees in Ontario who earned over $100,000 last year. The list is mandated by the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act enacted by the Ontario government under Premier Mike Harris, with the first list released in 1996.

By analyzing public sector incomes for those employees who earned over $100,000 annually, we seek to determine if the yearly publication can be used to evaluate fairness in the Ontario workforce. In our analysis we will be using the data to determine trends based on salaries, gender and potentially regions (urban vs rural). The sunshine list does not denote gender or location therefore we will use machine learning tools to predict gender and data cleansing teachniques to identify location.
