The goal of this project was to predict when and where accidents were likely to occur in New York City to enhance public safety and improve city planning. This may help with informing traffic laws and policies, guiding the allocation of resources, and optimizing police presence. By identifying high-risk areas and times, the city can implement preventative measures, such as improved signage or increased patrols, to reduce accidents. Furthermore, these insights can inform urban planning decisions, such as where to install traffic calming measures or redesign intersections, contributing to a safer and more efficient city for all residents. We used a dataset containing information about past motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, included features such as the date and time of the crash, the borough in which it occurred, the zip code, latitude, longitude, number of persons injured or killed, contributing factors for the vehicles involved, and the types of vehicles.

## [Coronary Heart Disease Risk Prediction](https://github.com/TyliOnel/Project_4-Group_5-Heart_Health)
Slides: [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGH3rGDzpU/w4Z7X-lqlxe-NptLHqb4iQ/edit)

Our project aims to address the issue of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk prediction by leveraging machine learning techniques. Utilizing technologies like Scikit-learn and other machine learning libraries, we will build a predictive model powered by a dataset with over 3000 records. This project will incorporate several key technologies, including Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, JavaScript Plotly, and potentially a SQL or MongoDB database.

## [Amazon Product Reviews](https://github.com/Amer4r/amazon_product_reviews_ML)

The purpose of this analysis is to develop and implement a model on Amazon Products Review to have a better understanding of customerâ€™s sentiments on different electronic devices. Use the model to determine the viability of the product (positive, neutral, negative) and which products are likely to increase sales.

Our Analysis also include analysing different factors such as Product Price, Product Star Rating, Number of Product Ratings, Sales Volume, Total Revenue. We also Built a dashboard for better understanding of our data: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charu.arora1569/viz/Book2AmazonDashboard-2/Dashboard1

Dataset was used from a live API called RapidAPI.

## [Miwaukee Listings Property](https://github.com/vivsarraf/Project-4)

The goal of this project is to provide users with an interactive dashboard for Milwaukee property listings that also provides the 2024 property price prediction using machine learning concepts.

The interactive dashboard will have only Milwaukee listings (28 properties) shown on the map, and contain information such as the address, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, lot size, and listing price.
The dashboard will have a filtering interface to allow users to filter by: min and max price, number of beds and baths, and square footage, and results will be shown below the map in a tabular format. The tabular presentation will have the list of properties and their property information.
Upon selecting a property from the list, additional information including the 2025 price predictions, will be shown below the table to aid users in the purchasing decisions.

## [Indian Premier League Score Prediction](https://github.com/kasheshjaiin/Project4_IPL)

This project involves predicting the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match using machine learning models. The data is processed and analyzed using Spark, and several machine learning models are implemented including a Neural Network, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.

The goal of the project is to create a machine learning model which helps to indicate which applicants would be eligible for a loan according to their credit score. The credit score is tested against 13 features that has been provided for each applicant. Our model will determine the applicant's credit worthiness for a loan based on the applicant's financial overview ( features): Age, Annual_Income, Monthly_Inhand_Salary, Num_Bank_Accounts, Num_Credit_Card, Interest_Rate, Num_of_Loan, Delay_from_due_date, Num_of_Delayed_Payment, Changed_Credit_Limit, Credit_Mix,.. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, using the Python programming language and several popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.tree and sklearn.ensemble.

## [Stock-Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/Emadkamali/Stock-Analysis)
Slides: [pdf](https://github.com/Emadkamali/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Presentation.pdf)

The project aims to forecast stock prices using machine learning models and technical indicators. Three main models were explored: Prophet with Technical Indicators, Prophet without Technical Indicators, and Gradient Boosting Regression. These models were analyzed and compared to determine the most suitable approach for stock price prediction.
