## [Malaria Detection using Cell Images](https://github.com/jnliou/project4)

The primary goal of this project is to utilize machine learning to analyze cell images from both individuals with and without malaria. This analysis aims to predict whether a subject has malaria, offering valuable assistance to healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process and making it more accessible to the general public. To achieve this objective, we have developed a web application that integrates an optimized machine learning model. This application is designed for use by students in the fields of science and medicine. Users can select a set of images they suspect may contain malaria and compare their assessments to the predictions made by the machine learning model. The primary intention behind this application is to serve as an educational tool, facilitating users in the easier identification of malaria-infected cells.

## [Housing Sales and Immigration](https://github.com/anastasiaskr2000/green-eggs-and-ham/tree/main)

Project 4 In accordance with feature importance and the constant coefficients produces via OLS< the most important X-values or factors impacting the Y, or housing value are year and immigrant count.

## [Bank Loans](https://github.com/ArminaCA/finalproject)



## [https://github.com/makramkb/Final_Project/tree/main](https://github.com/makramkb/Final_Project/tree/main)

In this project we have used data sample from Kaggle to predict a new client if a loan should be approved or not.

We have used different Machine learning process and run different modeling this include but not limited to Random Forest, Tree , VSM Linear Regression and more.

With 0.88 recall acurancy the model gave acceptebale result after training the data.

For visuaization we have used Tableau and JaveScript in order to give a better meaning for our data in a designed graphs fashion.

We used Flask in order to add more variety into the project and have our modules run through it.

## [Project 4: East Coast House Price Prediction](https://github.com/caohaoyun/project-4-service-providers)

Our project and learning model is focusing on analysis of house pricing in different cities of the US. We are curious about questions such as:

* what factors will affect pricing the most?
* does the most important factor differentiate in different cities?
* Which city has the most reasonable and stable pricing model?

## [Project-4-Global-Happiness-Insights-Prediction-with-Economic-indicators](https://github.com/Yasir-09/Project-4-Global-Happiness-Insights-Prediction-with-Economic-indicators)

This project leverages advanced data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for a happier world. The purpose of this project is to increase understanding of global happiness and well-being by leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques, ultimately providing actionable insights for a happier world. By analyzing large datasets and applying machine learning algorithms, we can uncover patterns and factors that contribute to happiness scores. These predictive models can help identify key drivers of happiness and inform policy decisions aimed at improving well-being worldwide.

## [Bank Loans](https://github.com/paololabuguen/project-4-web-scrapers)

For this project, we wanted to use machine learning models to predict based off of certain features if a bank loaner will default their loans. We have taken a dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitkalauni/bank-loan-defaulter-prediction-hackathon/data?select=submission.csv) to train and test our machine learning models on.

## [Medical and demographic factors linked to Diabetes](https://github.com/laurajanefaulds/project4)

Use machine learning models to figure out relationships between different medical and demographic factors and link it to the possibility of developing diabetes.



## [Credit Card Fraud Transactions](https://github.com/Elee-Saleem/team-6-project-4)

The objective of this analysis was to observe 100,000 credit card fraudulent transactions and determine how credit card transactions can be classified as safe & trusted or fraudulent. With our analysis, we wanted to see what patterns recur in fraudulent transactions and how this can lead to prevention.
