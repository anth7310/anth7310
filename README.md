# Sabaidi 😃 (Hello in Laos!) 👋



### Hi there, I'm Anthony
I'm a graduate from the 🎓**University of Toronto** specialized in **Machine Learning and Data Science**. I'm also a freelance data engineer, data scientist, teaching assistant, and book nerd!

I enjoy learning about Large Scale Systems related to Big Data and Machine Learning. Skills I'm proficient are
* Python Programming
* Data Structures and Algorithms

I'm currently learning various ☁️ cloud technologies with a focus on AWS. I'm also planning on achieving some certifications related to AWS cloud development.

## 🔥 Interests

I also enjoy [freelancing](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01769f053889fb653a?viewMode=1) and [teaching](https://www.superprof.ca/statistical-machine-learning-and-data-science-student-teaching-computer-science-programming-python.html). I've always been very passionate about learning and problem solving.

Outside of tech too, I love pushing myself to develop new skills ranging from 🎸guitar, 🚀 rock climbing, and 🎹 touch typing
