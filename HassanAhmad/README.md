## [Classification of readmittance rate using Diabetes Dataset](https://github.com/nisahahmed90/Final-Project/blob/main/FINAL%20README.md)

Diabetes is a very common disease with a wide range of ages. But the treatment varies from patient to patient. Medication regimens and efficiency cycles are also very different for each patient. We used patient information from 130 U.S. hospitals from 1999 to 2008. Through the data, we will analyze the response, cycle and drug resistance rate of different patients to treatment drugs. However, through a large amount of data analysis can provide limited information. Therefore, our project will use machine learning techniques to analyze patients' responses to drugs based on different attributes and determine what are the features that are affecting the readmittance rate.

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oaa0Y5AZDGz9G3kXevB4ilNd6daVcAft2hufuMcEvdE/edit#slide=id.g142b1849051_2_50)

Primary Objectives: The primary objective is to predict if the loan status of the applicant has been approved or not. For this project, we take on the role of financial analyst for a finance company to build our model to predict the outcome of the loan status of customers using different data values. For this project, we will use the classification model in which we need to classify whether the loan will be approved or not. classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.

Business problem: We work for a finance company that deals in all kinds of home loans. Usually, an applicant first applies for a home loan and after that, the company validates the customer's eligibility for the loan. We aim to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer details provided while filling out online application forms. These details are:

Gender, Marital Status, Education, number of Dependents, I Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

## [Customer Reviews](https://github.com/KF59874/final_group_project)
As a group, we have decided to anlayze the importance of customer reviews for businesses. We decided to focus on this topic, seeing as positive reviews, can be a great way for word-of-mouth advertisement for businesses. They can be a deciding factor as to whether customers will visit a business. Furthermore, from the business perspective, business owners can also improve their business model and increase their customer base by looking at common words that are frequently mentioned in reviews. These frequent words, can additionally be a great source for directed advertisement on social media platforms and in search enginges.

## [Analysis of adverse reaction of FDA Approved medicine class](https://github.com/tannazmo/Group-Project-10)
Adverse drug events (ADEs) are defined as injuries resulting from medication use. Adverse reporting data have proven to be useful evidence in predicting adverse drug effects and flagging potential safety issues. Taking one the most prescribed class of drugs, statins, we used FDA adverse reporting data to analyze their potential adverse reactions and predict the most undesirable ones!

## [Fraud vs Non-Fraud Jobs](https://github.com/Ikyupark/Capstone-project)

Data and the age of technology has nonetheless benefitted society a great deal. However, it is not to say that such advancements hasn't been accompanied by down-sides. One of which is identity fraud. The ability for fraudsters, scammers, and hackers to access information as they please is unprecedented and unsuspecting victims often succumb to methods such as phone calls, emails or even fake job postings! In an effort to prevent identity theft, using a data set acquired from kaggle, we aim to create a machine learning model that can predict fraud vs non-fraud jobs based on several parameters.

## [Grocery Store](https://github.com/SavFidani/Grocery_Store)

Ever since the world has begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a new attitude towards uses of physical space throughout several asset classes in the realm of commercial real estate. We have seen corporate users of space move to less square footage and more flexibility in regard to offices. We have seen many institutional buildings sit somewhat empty for two years with staggering levels of return. What we will seek to analyze, is whether there is a need for larger physical retail spaces. Our analysis will seek to understand the relationship between a large retail space, supplies and ultimately profits.

To summarize, our key question is does a larger retail space lead to higher profits for the occupying company?

## [Airline Delays](https://github.com/gdevashrayee/capstone_project-airline-delays)

One of the most recognisable performance metrics of any transportation system is a delay. Notably, those involved in commercial aviation define delay as the amount of time that an aircraft is running late or postponed. Authorities in charge of national regulatory oversight have a wide range of indications relating to tolerance limits for aircraft delays. In the context of air transportation networks, flight delays are undoubtedly an important topic. Every year approximately 25-30% of flights are delayed, costing passengers and the operations approximately $36 billion in money and their time.

The purpose of this project is to thoroughly analyse the historic data, gain valuable insights, experiment with the input features to see how the prediction accuracy varies, and contribute to the identification of solutions based on the results.

Flight prediction is crucial during the decision-making process for all players of commercial aviation. By conducting an analysis of flight times and metrics regarding airlines, day of travel, and airport arrivals/departures we can predict what flights are more likely to experience delays.

## [Video Game Sales](https://github.com/kntln/Video_Games_Sales)

For this project, we have selected to analyze video games sales. We have chosen this topic because we are interested in looking at factors affecting video game sales such as genre, developer, critic score, platform and ESRB rating. The first dataset was collected from the Kaggle dataset. There are 55,792 records in the dataset as of April 12th, 2019. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. The second data set contains information about video-games publishers.

The questions we hope to answer from the analysis are as follows:

* What is the overall trend of global sales for video games?
* How do factors such as genre, critic score, and developer affect video games sales?
* Can we make a prediction about video games sales based on the following factors mentioned above?

## [DataCo Supply Chain](https://github.com/amonjaras/Team08_DataCo_SC_Data_Analysis)

During the last 5 years DataCo Global has experienced an increase on "Late deliveries" in all the markets. Business Managers and Directors from DataCo Global are looking for a solution to improve and have their company recognized as On-time delivery.

Our goal is directed into answering the following questions:

* How to predict the supply chain disruption?
* What type of features are impacting those disruptions?

## [Electric Car Sales vs. Gas Prices](https://github.com/mckjack/Electric-Car-Sales)

We selected this topic due to rising gas prices and we wanted to study how it impacts consumer purchases for automobiles. Our hypothesis is that the gas prices do impact consumer choices.

Questions we hope to answer:
1. Did rising/falling gas prices have any effect on electric car sales in the US?
2. Did answer to #1 vary significantly depending on car models?
3. Can we predict electric car sales over the next year based on available datasets?
4. Can we predict gas prices over the next year?
5. Are electric car sales higher where infrastructure is more available?

## [Airbnb Toronto Price Prediction](https://github.com/Sukanya807/Airbnb_Toronto_Price_Prediction)
Airbnb is an American company that operates an online community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book accommodations worldwide. Home-owners (also known as 'hosts') are allowed to rent their properties (also known as 'listings') ranging from entire homes, apartments, single or shared bedrooms to individuals or businesses for a charge.

Although Airbnb provides the host with a general tip regarding the default nightly price of their property upon listing, the final decision regarding the property price ultimately rests with the host. Paid third party pricing softwares are available, however the hosts are required to first determine the average price by themselves. The algorithm will then vary the daily price around the base price each day depending on several factors such as seasonality, day of the week, etc. In today's dynamic market, it is extremely important for the Airbnb owners to get the pricing right, particularly in big cities like Toronto, where there is stiff competition and a very thin line between success and failure.

## [UofT Credit Union](https://github.com/mustafaikizler/Data_Analytics_Project)

UofT Credit Union is a financial institution that provides financial services including checking and saving accounts, financial advice, mortgages and more. According to the latest reports, shareholders found that digital engagement between the company and customers is lower than the expected rate. We know that online services are the fastest and most efficient way to reach the customer to present profitable products. This data analysis project firstly will focus on existing customer data such as demography, financial status, and spending behaviors. (Payment types and amounts.). According to the result of the analysis, the model can be implemented for future customers for forecasting purposes. Machine learning techniques will be our main tool for grouping the customers. By the end of our analysis, we will try to identify the group of customers that will be eligible to receive online services engagement promotions.

Questions we hope to answer with the data
* What is the online bank penetration in the different age ranges?
* Is there a consumer cluster more prone to use Online bank?
* In the cluster that is more prone to use Online bank, are there users that do not use or that could use it more often?
* What behaviours can be detected in customers in 2018 to predict trends and offer promotions and discounts to drive online engagement?

## [Credit Score Analysis](https://github.com/NKKhosa/group_14_project)
Credit scores are a universal metric, used by companies and individuals alike, in various areas of life to make decisions. With this dataset, we hope to perform a deep learning classification analysis of the data to determine whether we can predict if an individual will have a good or bad credit score based on the input features provided.

A credit score can considerably influence your economic existence. It plays a key function in a lender's decision to offer you credit. People accompanying credit scores beneath 640, e.g., are mainly deliberate expected subprime borrowers. Lending organizations frequently charge interest on subprime mortgages at a rate above a unoriginal mortgage to offset themselves from bearing more risk. They grant permissions like demanding a smaller compensation term or a co-signer for borrowers accompanying a low credit score

## [The prognostic discovery for type 2 diabetes and its hetergeneity](https://github.com/Jialin0315/group12)

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, a mystery for modern medicine leaving no cure. As such, the early diagnosis (prediction) is essential to stop or delay the onset of future T2D. However, the current clinical prognostics have very poor accuracy which warrents the discovery of a highly accurate prognostics.

For prognostic or predictive diagnostic discovery, we need a longitudinal study propulation, and some of these participants should develop T2D within a few of study. Here, we are using a metabolomics dataset of a population from whom some developed T2D within 5 years. We have taken 30 participants metabolomics dataset who devepoled T2D within 5 years. We pair-matched them to 28 controls who did not developed T2D. The pair-matching was carried out using age, BMI, sex, and race.

This investigation employed a precision medicine approach on a baseline (none of them had T2D) metabolomics dataset to develop a nested pair-matched case-control study using 58 participants. participants who did not progress to T2D within few years from baseline time are classified as “Control.” Each control is then pair-matched with case participants who developed T2D within same years from baseline time point.
