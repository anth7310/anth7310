## [Airbnb Price Prediction City of Boston](https://github.com/Pascalduc/Group_6_Final_Project)

Estimating a price for short time stay lodging is a difficult task for the hosts when it comes to listing the property in Airbnb. In addition, customers select rental based on price, review, and picture of the property, but the property may not live up to its listing. Therefore, our team decided to develop a price prediction model using machine learning to predict the ideal price using the listing features from the dataset.


## [Bank Marketing Targets Predictions](https://github.com/vd1310/Banking-Dataset-MarketingTargetsPrediction)

Every business has a limited marketing budget. Therefore it's vital that each dollar is spent in the most efficient way possible. In a bank's case, it's necessary to determine which of their clients will be receptive to phone marketing campaigns regarding the bank's financial services, specifically term deposits. Term deposits are similar to GICs, where a client will give the bank money in exchange for the money plus interest after a fixed period of time. During this time, the client is unable to withdraw their money.

The motivation behind the topic is to determine if marketing campaigns through phone calls is an effective use of marketing spend by companies such as a bank or large institution. This could also shed light on why so many people recieve fraudulent phone calls of people claiming to be from IRS/CRA demanding money. If phone campaigns are truly effective, then one would expect to continue receiving fraudulent calls.


## [Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://github.com/EMarksCyr/Final_Project_Health_Outcome_Prediction)

Mental and physical health outcomes are currently dire in North America.

* 42.4% obesity prevalence in the U.S. as of 2018 (CDC, 2021)
* The Major Depressive Disorder affects > 6.7% of U.S. adults in a given year (ADAA, 2021)
    * Leading cause of disability in the U.S. for ages 15 to 44.3 (ADAA, 2021).
* Approximately 39.5% of men and women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2015–2017 data; National Cancer Inst., 2020)

The current health landscape is incredibly complex. There is an abundance of information on health online with advice for optimizing health, losing weight, or curing diseases with varying degrees of reliability. It's challenging to discern how to best take care of ourselves with so many novel factors at play.

The more clarity we can provide on improving outcomes, the better we can empower the public to take positive steps for their quality of life.


## [Canadian Election Study Analysis](https://github.com/jhilberdink/Canadian_Election_Study_Analysis)

This project examines the Canadian Election Study, a large-scale survey conducted before and after the 2019 Canadian Federal election. In our analysis, we seek to uncover the key factors that drive Canadian voting preferences.

The CES is a rich datasource that covers a wide number of issues, and members of the group are interested in Canadian politics.

Questions we hope to answer:
* Is it possible to predict respondents' party preference based on survey responses?
* What are the key factors that drive Canadian voting choices?

## [Project Goldendwarf](https://github.com/findthefunction/goldendwarf)

Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing techniques to predict future price movements of cryptocurrencies (and stocks) as well as gauging social sentiment of the crypto universe.

## [Environmental Factors and Effects on Human Well-Being and Happiness](https://github.com/SDCoulter/final_project)

We are setting out to look at how the environment around us affects how happy we are, and how strong this effect is. We will do this by looking at the environmental variables of countries, and seeing if we can use them to predict the Life Ladder target variable from the World Happiness Index.

Is the environment a major source of the quality of life for humanity? Or is it merely a small part of a much larger story?

## [Fake News](https://github.com/NoraYounes/Fake_News_Detection/tree/main)

Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue. There is no fixed definition of a false news story, and, in fact, the term is used more broadly to encompass any type of misinformation, including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also to apply to news unfavourable to one's own personal views.

In a time when we can spread and receive information quickly, thanks to the technology and 4G networks , media literacy is very important. Detecting fake news has become more important than ever for the sake of a peaceful society. A prediction tool would be a terrific way to help people make more educated decisions on news.

We are working on a solution that users can use to identify news containing false and misleading information. The post and title of a fake article are analyzed using simple and carefully selected features.

## [FK HL Model Remake](https://github.com/ChiefMetDing/FK_HL_Model_Remake)

I have no idea what this project is but it was done by a student in this course.

## [Formula One Race Predictions](https://github.com/Vignesh-Bala11/Capstone-Project/tree/main)

Sports present a vast amount of data that have been used to create a whole new paradigm of performance, team management and strategies. One sport that seems to have an over-reliance of data analysis is Formula 1 (F1). Formula 1 represents the pinnacle of automotive technology with hundreds of cars being fitted with state-of-the-art sensors generating significant amount of data, approximately 3gb per race along with 1500 datapoints, which teams monitor to determine tire performance, driver performance, track conditions etc. Few sports rely on the use of data analytics as extensively as F1 and as such major Technology companies such as Amazon Web Services, Qualcomm Technologies, Splunk all have major strategic relations with the competing teams.

## [Algorithmic Trading](https://github.com/mdabbous88/Machine-Learning-Investment)

The project purpose is to utilize the correlation between stock price movement and technical analysis to predict future price of a stock using Machine Learning. Technical analysis uses technical indicators which are mathematical calculations that are used by traders to predict the future price of a security. The technical indicators that will be used in the study are:

- Simple Moving Average (SMA)

- Relative Strength Index (RSI)

- Bollinger Bands (BB)

The dataset is scraped from Yahoo Finance API based on the stock symbol the user enters. A machine learning model will be created using Close price, Open price, High price, Low price, Adjusted Close price, Volume, SMA, RSI and BB as inputs and the output will be adjusted close price of the security.

## [NBA Salary](https://github.com/deanpaularnold/nba_salaries)

NBA statistics are a key metric in terms of evaluating player performance and contribution, which in turn leads to their final goal of winning games and championships. In other words, generally speaking, higher performance should lead to higher statistics. Additionally, players tend to be paid based on their perceived value, which can be measured by these statistics.Our goal is to determine if we can predict the player’s salaries or salary ranges based on their statistics.

## [Spotify Song Recommendations](https://github.com/JenKlein/SpotifyRecommenderSystem)

The app can be a useful tool for discovering new music, however it often recommends music similar to the music you're already listening too. It can be difficult and tedious to find new music generally, and especially music that's more disimilar and discover new artists from different genres.

Our group is curious to explore the backend of user recommendation machine learning models with Spotify music data, and to also create a model that will provide music recommendations that you can customize to make similar to your music taste or different. Our model will analyze a user's favourite song and provide song suggestions based on the similarity of musical features such as danceability, acousticness, energy, tempo, and so on. We believe by using this model this expands the usefulness of the spotify recommendation platform to help users discover new music, increases user satisfaction with spotify and ultimately increases the number of active users on spotify.


## [Stock Profile and Investment Strategies](https://github.com/shuklaashi2303/FinalProjectStock)

Can a client's profile predict successful/growth in stock investment?

This project is purely for educational & research purposes and should not be considered as advice or endorsement for investing in any stocks used for this study. The stock market is a lucrative way to earn money in the long & short term. It is a gamble that can often lead to a profit or a loss. There is no proper prediction model for stock prices. The price movement is highly influenced by the demand and supply for a stcok at a given time. This is majorly due to the volatile nature of the market and how a new can influence a stock's price. This study aims at predicting stock data for the future using technical analysis. Technical analysis is a study which reinforces that history repeats itself and through this study, we are using past data to predict future data using machine learning.

## [Twitter versus Stocks Analysis](https://github.com/angkohtenko/twitter_vs_stocks/tree/main)

Posts in social media often cause changes in the stock market that may lead to unpredictable losses in one's investment portfolio. In this project we analyse which words are more powerful and what influence they may have. Will they bring losses or profits to our portfolio? 💰

As an example, we take tweets posted by Elon Musk and investigate how they may impact Tesla's stock prices.

Using Twitter API we collected all posts made by Elon Musk in 2021 along with counts of likes, replies, and retweets. We merged it with another dataset of Elon's tweets for 2011-2020 found on Kaggle. All Elon's reposts and replies were excluded from analysis.

Yahoo_fin library was used to get historical Tesla's stock price data for the same period.

Classification and LDA models were built to analyse datasets.


## [Water Potability Classification](https://github.com/Lamismn/Water_Potability_Classification)

This project's aim is to determine the potability of water based on different readings of different quality metrics for different samples of water from stations across India.

Water is a key element for life. Many regions around the world suffer from clean water scarcity, which makes water potability one of the most crucial topics on Earth. The aim of this study is to determine whether we could develop a machine learning model that could determine the water class and its potability based on different characteristic readings.
