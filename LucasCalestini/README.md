## [Toronto Collisions Analysis](https://github.com/rrovy4/group_7_final_project)

The purpose of our project is to analyze Killed and Seriously Injured data taken from the Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal and determine which areas are considered high risk for fatal and non-fatal collisions. This analysis will help inform daily commuters of these high-risk areas and aid city officials develop proper safety measures to reduce the number of collisions.

## [NBA Player Analysis](https://github.com/joshb738/NBA_Player_Analysis)

Using unsupervised machine learning to analyze player decline in the NBA based on the player archetype. This analysis will provide assistance to NBA teams for roster building and player adjustments.

The analysis will aim to provide insight on the following questions:

1. Determining the new player archytpe in the modern day position list.
2. Will adjusting the athletes playstyle help improve performance.

## [Pokemon OCR Price Comparator](https://github.com/benaziziasmae/squirtle_squad/tree/main)

The purpose of this app is to price check a Pok√©mon TCG card based on the user input via a still frame image (captured via video, scan or static image of the card) they wish to know about. Then through machine learning & computer vision, a packet of information consisting at minimum of the collector number, if recognizable, will be sent to a function that will perform the query in a regularly updatable database.

## [Spotify Analysis](https://github.com/halmasieh/Spotify_Analysis)
Spotify's Popularity index uses an algorithm to evaluate a song, largely based off of the number of plays a song gets. The better the evaluation, the more likely an artist and their music will be recommended to a larger number of viewers. Said simply, the greater a song's Popularity index, the greater its presence in the Spotify community.

The goal of this project will be to determine what features impact the Popularity index of any given song on Spotify. By analyzing various physical features of a song as well as some peripheral features, we look to identify a pattern within how a song garners a successful Popularity index. Using this knowledge, we hope to be able to create a model that can predict the popularity of a song based on these features.

## [Post COVID-19 Vacation Planner](https://github.com/nasarar/Post_Covid19_Vacation_Projection)

The project aims to identify and forecast countries that will reach herd immunity by inducing the Arima model on the updated covid fully vaccinated data from our world. The model will evaluate and forecast the future data based on the past and present vaccination rate.

The herd immunity is reached when 70% of the population are fully vaccinated with both the doses.

The people planning to travel in the near future can visit the website and check for a future date for travel to a particular destination, and the model will help them to know the countries that will reach herd immunity and will mark it as safe for travel.

The model can also be fine-tuned for NGOs to know which countries will need help in reaching the herd immunity by providing the details of the earliest date and year by which a particular country can be marked safe for travel.

NGO's directed by WHO/UN can then send a team with vaccinations and mobile medical unit to vaccinate countries/state who will be ready for such assistance.

## [Final Effluent Total Phosphorus Analysis](https://github.com/Hala-INTJ/Final_Project)

This project will work with data provided by a Wastewater Treatment Facility. The plant supervisor has to accommodate new limits coming into effect in the near future for Final Effluent Total Phosphorus (TP). There are strict limits on effluent released into the environment, and the goal is to determine if the TP can be predicted, or if an exceedance event can be classified from the existing plant SCADA data (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) such as flow rates, chemical dosing and lab analysis results. The plant supervisor has some working theories on existing metrics which may contribute to TP exceedances such as: sludge buildup in primaries causing solids to carry over out of the primaries. This information will be used in building and training of one or more models. The goal is to create a 'warning system' to provide early notification when a TP exceedance may be imminent


## [Impact of climate variables on Covid 19 cases](https://github.com/archinarula/Group-5-Project)
The new novel corona virus known as Covid19 (SARS CoV-2), has caused one of the most serious health crises globally. Since its global spread last year, we've seen multiple news article around the impact of temperature and humidity on the speed of spread and whetheer or not virus thrive in colder temerpatur. A simple Google search using term "covid spread cold and dry weather news" will yelid multiple articles from credible news outlet and statiscal and scentfice websites in favor or against.

## [Deciphering the Indus Valley Script](https://github.com/Kee2u/Deciphering_the_Indus_Valley_Script)

This project is an attempt to decipher the ancient Indus Valley script by comparing it with modern Tamil (a Dravidan language).
Our strategy is to:
Convert Tamil script from phonetic to logosyllabic by converting morphemes to signs. Perform statistical analysis to compare the converted script with the Indus script.

Here are notes on terminology:
Tamil - A Dravidian language
Phonetic script - A writing system whose characters represent phonemes or sounds (like English).
Logosyllabic script - A writing systems whose characters represent syllables, words and morphemes.
Morpheme - The smallest part of a word that changes its meaning. Ex- 'ing' in 'following'

## [Condo Price Predictions](https://github.com/Johnnywang1899/Data-Analytics-Boot-Camp---Final-Project)

Through evaluating different project topics by complexity, feasibility to complete and accessibility of data source, group #9 decides to choose real estate condo sale pricing prediction within the Toronto area as the focus for this project.
